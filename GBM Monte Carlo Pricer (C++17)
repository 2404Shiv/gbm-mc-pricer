Single-binary MC pricer for European calls/puts under GBM with **Greeks**, **antithetic + control-variate** variance reduction, and a 1-day **P&L/VaR** panel.

## Why it matters
Clean MC engineering, numerics, variance-reduction craft, and a risk linkage — core Strats/QR competencies.

## Features
- GBM paths; European call/put
- Variance reduction: **antithetic** + **control variate** with optimal \(b^\*\)
- Greeks: **BS closed-form**, **pathwise Δ**, **CRN bump** for Γ/Vega/Θ/ρ
- Risk: 1-day revaluation **VaR95/99** and **ES95**
- Reproducible (seeded), portable C++17, no deps

## Build
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
./build/pricer
